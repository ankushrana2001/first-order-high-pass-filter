## 📄 Project Overview

This virtual lab project demonstrates how to design and analyze the frequency response curve of a first-order active Butterworth high pass filter using **IC 741**. The aim is to help students visualize and understand the functioning of analog filter circuits through a digital platform.

### Key Objectives:
- Design a High Pass Filter using op-amp IC 741.
- Understand the role of each component in the circuit.
- Analyze the frequency response and gain characteristics.
- Provide interactive simulation and explanation for better learning.

## 📈 Theoretical Background

- **Filter Type:** First-order Butterworth High Pass Filter
- **Op-Amp Used:** IC 741
- **Cut-off Frequency Formula:**  
  \[
  f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi RC}
  \]

- **Voltage Gain Equation:**  
  \[
  A_v = \frac{V_{\text{out}}}{V_{\text{in}}} = \frac{A_F \left(\frac{f}{f_c}\right)}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{f}{f_c}\right)^2}}
  \]

- **Frequency Response:** Passes high frequencies while attenuating low frequencies. The gain increases with frequency beyond the cut-off.
